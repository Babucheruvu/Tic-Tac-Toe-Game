Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. It is a great example of a game involving logic, strategy, and decision-making. The game ends when one player achieves a win or when the grid is full without a winner (draw).

How the Game Works
Setup:

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
Two players participate: one uses "X" and the other uses "O".
Gameplay:

Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell of the grid.
The goal is to create a sequence of three identical symbols (X or O) in a straight line.
Winning Conditions: A player wins if they place three of their symbols in:

A horizontal row.
A vertical column.
A diagonal line.
Draw: If all nine cells are filled and neither player has a winning combination, the game is a draw.

Game Flow
Player Turn: The current player chooses an empty cell to place their symbol.
Check for Win: After every turn, check if the current player has a winning combination.
Check for Draw: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Switch Players: If the game isn’t over, switch turns and repeat.

Copy code
Step 1: Player X places at (1,1)       Step 2: Player O places at (1,2)
   X | O |  
  ---|---|---
     |   |  
  ---|---|---
     |   |  

Step 3: Player X places at (2,2)       Step 4: Player O places at (3,1)
   X | O |  
  ---|---|---
     | X |  
  ---|---|---
   O |   |  

Step 5: Player X places at (3,3) -> X Wins!
   X | O |  
  ---|---|---
     | X |  
  ---|---|---
   O |   | X
Programming a Tic-Tac-Toe Game
If you’re creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game, here are some implementation ideas:

Logic:

Use a 2D array to represent the board.
Check winning conditions after each move.
Ensure the cell is empty before placing a symbol.
User Interface:

Console-based: Players enter their moves via text input.
Graphical UI: Use libraries like HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web or frameworks like React, or game engines.
AI (Optional):

Implement a basic AI for a single-player mode.
Use algorithms like minimax to make the AI smarter.
